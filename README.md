# bunqShortcuts
A small proxy API for the bunq API - To use with Siri Shortcuts

## What's this? 🤔
This sample API is written for a bunq API tutorial.
You can find the tutorial at [bunq Developers’ Corner](#ADD_URL_WHEN_LIVE) on Medium.
The goal of the tutorial was to be able to ask Siri about your bunq account balance.
This small API can be used as a starting point. 
But if you're adding more advance features it's better to replace the simple API Key authentication, with something like JWT tokens. 🔐

And if you're planning on using this, it's better to remove the hardcoded API key from the code. 
This is only done for easier demonstration purposes.
